# Deep-Learning
Hello,
This repository includes some of the Deep - Learning assignments and algorithms that I have implemented and coded on various datasets. Feel free to approach me in case of collaborations or any sort of improvements/suggestions.

Some of the codes like the unsupervised Deep Learning algorithms are from the online course that I undertook to improve my Deep learning skills. Other ANN and CNN are applied on common datasets like the MNIST dataset.

The repository also contains the case studies given to me by my mentor that I have solved using Jupyter Notebook. The larger files and datasets are included in the text file that is present in the repository which contain the link for them. Plese find the required files there.

Thank you
